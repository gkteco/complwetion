Complwetion is a wrapper around an LLM provider and a Vector DB with common utilities like:
- crawling the web
- batching text into a list of desired sequence lengths
- Performing RAG
- vectorizing lists of sequences
- connecting to a vector db
- connecting to a LLM provider


The goal is to provide an elegant interface to build LLM powered backends.
